Albert Einstein once said :
>Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.

>The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination

>Imagination is more important than knowledge.

which is the most important thing for programming

Alan Turing:

>Sometimes it is the people no one can imagine anything of who do
the things no one can imagine.
